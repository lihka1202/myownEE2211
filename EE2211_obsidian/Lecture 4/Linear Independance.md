What does this mean?

In simpler terms, if at any point in time, the various columns in a matrix can be multiplied by 0 to get the answer.

Essentially, if you have two matrices/vectors, and you can represent one vector in the form of another, **By simply multiplying one with a scalar**, then these two rows/column/vectors are linearly independant
