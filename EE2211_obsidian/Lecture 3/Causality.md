The influence by which one event or process contributes to another event

It is important to note the following:
**The cause is partially responsible for the effect and the effect is partially dependant for the cause**

One popular way to do causality analysis is called a **Random Controlled Trial(RCT)**
- A study design that randomly assigns participants into an experimental group or a control group
- As the study is conducted, the only expected different between the 2 groups is the outcome of the variable being studied


# Correlation
- In stats, correlation is any statistical relationhip, whether causal or not, between any 2 random variables
- These are very useful as they can indicate a **predictive relationship that can be explored in the practice**
- Linear Coefficient **r** is known as the Pearson Coefficient



**Note that Correlation does not imply any form of causation**

First, let us talk about the Axioms of Probability
$$
\begin{matrix} P(A)  \geq 0 \\ P(S) = 1 \end{matrix}
$$
Either way, you can just use the following code:
