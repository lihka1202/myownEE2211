Q1, just normal linear regression
Adding the bias allows one to better fit the line, as an affine function is not limited to passing through the origin

Q2
Just use the Tut 4 package and do it, should be fine

Q3

just make sure to ==read the question clearly and ensure that you copy all the data points down==


The weighted norm of the questions can be calculated as such:
$$
w = \left( X^{T}QX\right)^{-1}X^{T}Qy
$$



A few pointers to note
1. Copy data properly

Remember to not use polyfit

Speedrun all the coding examples one last time tomorrow morning and see hwo this goes
