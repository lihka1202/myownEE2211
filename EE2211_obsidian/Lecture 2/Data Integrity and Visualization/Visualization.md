You can visualize data in 2 main ways:
- Distributions, something like this:

- Or Bars or Histograms, each are used for their own purpose

- Or largely in the form of BoxPlots
	- Boxplots are better used in understanding the **various Quartiles** and the **outliers**
		- The 1st Quartile (**Q1**) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number(ie the minimum) and the median of the data set
		- The third Quartile (**Q3**) is the middle number between the median and the highest value.
- Sometimes Datasets can have identical **means, variances and regression lines**, it is essential to use **Visualization** in that case to show the difference
