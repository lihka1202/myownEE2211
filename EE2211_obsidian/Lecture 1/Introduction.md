- Some key points from the introductory lecture:
	- There is a clear difference between **Deep learning, AI and ML**
	- This diagram should elucidate that well:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230206205049.png]]
- An example of AI, but not ML is **deductive reasoning**
	- Nus is in Singapore --> Singapore is in Asia ---> NUS is in Asia
	- ML cannot do that

## Application of Machine Learning
Machine Learning models are built  off the following 
- Task T
- Performace P
- Experience E
	- You can guage and rate any model based off these few requirements


# Main Task of ML
To make some kind of inference, there are mainly 2 kinds of inference:
- **Inductive**:
	- TO reach probably conclusions
	- Not all the **required information is available, leaving a lot of room for uncertanity**.
	- More based off probability and stats
- **Deductive**:
	- To reach logical conclusions **deterministically**
	- All the information that can lead to the correct conclusion is available, more or less.

Generally, Humans are pretty bad at inductive reasoning and better at deductive reasoning (Unless you take stats as a major then it might be different).
