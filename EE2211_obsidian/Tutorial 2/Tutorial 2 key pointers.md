There are a few key pointers, however the most important ones are listed below:

# Min Max Normalization
A simple way to ensure this is to use the following formula:
$$
x_{i} = \frac{x^{raw}-x^{min}}{x^{max} - x^{min}}
$$

# Data types
There are a few main catrgories, we can list these as the following:
Broadly, you have 2 main types:

## Categorical Variables
These are variables which *cannot be counted or measured* using numbers and hence are divided into clusters of sorts. These are **qualitative data types**
These can be further divided in to 2 main kinds:

### Nominal 
- No quantitative data types
- **NO ORDER**
- Changing the order of Nomminal Data makes no difference
	- Like Gender, Language etc

### Ordinal
- No quantiative data
- But changing the order **will affect the data**
- Something like Rank, Traffic LIght. Fruit Quality
- The differences between the options is **harder to quantify**

## Numerical Data
This is the OG Qualitative Data
It has some numerical value which makes this very countable
This can be further broken down into the following data types

### Interval
- Variables can have values **below 0**, IE there is no *true zero*
- There is order and the interval is useful
	- Temp in Celsius
	- Temp in Farenheit
	- pH
### Ratio
- True zero **Exists**
- When there is 0 of some variable, it vanishes
- There is order and the data is useful
	- Duration in Seconds
	- Height in meters
	- Temp in Kelvin

### Discrete
- Generally integers
- Cannnot be measured but can be counted

### Continuous
- Measurements which can be fractional
- COlour, or temperature.
- The height of a person
- These cannot be counted but can be measuredd
